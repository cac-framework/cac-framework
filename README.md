# Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework
A lightweight framework for transparent cross platform communication of controller data in ambient assisted living environments. The framework supports several modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple requesting applications, using standard, real time, internet communication technologies. It consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllersâ€™ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components.
